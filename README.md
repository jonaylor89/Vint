# Simple Text Editor
-------------------------

This is a terminal based text editor written C. I was inspired to do this from
a tutorial on the internet. For
fun I continue tinkering with this project.

TODO:
--------
1. Better syntax highlighting
2. Color themes
3. More Configurations

### Would be interesting to try and write this in rust?
Rust is in the works
