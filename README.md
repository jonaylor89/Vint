# Simple Text Editor
-------------------------

This is a terminal based text editor that was written in C and then ported to
rust. I was inspired to do this from a tutorial on the internet. For fun I continue tinkering with this project.

TODO:
--------
1. Better syntax highlighting
2. Color themes
3. More Configurations
